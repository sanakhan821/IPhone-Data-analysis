# 📱 IPhone Data Analysis

This project explores key trends and patterns in iPhone product data. It focuses on how features like **sale price**, **discount percentage**, **ratings**, and **number of reviews** are interrelated. The aim is to extract actionable insights using clean data visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze how product pricing affects user reviews and ratings.
- Study the impact of discount percentages on product popularity.
- Identify which product attributes drive customer engagement.
- Create clear, interactive visualizations to present insights.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Dataset: `apple_products.csv`

## 📈 Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to communicate findings effectively:

- `ratings_vs_price_plot.png`: Correlation between product ratings and price.
- `reviews_vs_price_plot.png`: Number of reviews versus product sale price.
- `discount_vs_reviews.png`: Relationship between discount offered and user reviews.
- `saleprice_vs_reviews.png`: Visualizing how sale price influences review count.
- ✅ **Interactive Plotly Visual**: Added for exploring sale price vs. number of reviews with tooltips and zoom.
